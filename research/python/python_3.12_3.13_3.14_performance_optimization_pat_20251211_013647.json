    {
      "name": "Structured Pattern Matching for Dispatch",
      "legacy": "Long if/elif/else chains or dictionary-based dispatch with manual checks.",
      "modern": "Using `match` statements (structural pattern matching) for efficient and readable dispatch logic.",
      "benefit": "Improved code clarity and potential for faster execution due to optimized pattern matching implementations in the interpreter. Eliminates the overhead of multiple conditional checks."

      "legacy": "Manual attribute checking or `dataclasses` with runtime checks for type correctness.",
      "modern": "Utilizing `TypedDict` for defining data structures with type hints. Can be used with static analysis tools and may provide more efficient runtime checks.",
      "benefit": "Enhanced static analysis, potential for faster runtime validation (depending on usage and static type checking), clearer intent."
    },

      "name": "Self Type Annotations for Method Resolution",
      "legacy": "Manual class inheritance and method overriding; potential for incorrect method resolution or unclear inheritance hierarchies.",
      "modern": "Using `typing.Self` to annotate methods that return an instance of the same class. Improves code readability and potentially optimizes method resolution.",

      "benefit": "Reduced boilerplate code, potentially faster JSON processing due to optimized dataclass construction and the advancements in the `json` module.  Data integrity is better guaranteed through type annotations within the dataclass."

      "legacy": "Complex regex patterns often led to performance bottlenecks.",
      "modern": "Leverage the ongoing improvements in the `re` module, particularly for pattern compilation and more efficient matching algorithms. Employ non-capturing groups `(?:...)` where appropriate.",

      "legacy": "Iterating through dictionaries for key lookups can be slow.",

      "name": "Avoiding Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) Bottlenecks",
      "legacy": "Multithreading with Python's GIL limited true parallelism.",
      "modern": "Using multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks, leveraging libraries like `asyncio` for I/O-bound concurrency, and exploring alternative implementations of the GIL (future Python versions may have better GIL support).",
      "benefit": "Improved utilization of multi-core processors, higher throughput for concurrent tasks."
    },
    {
      "name": "Traceback Simplification",
      "legacy": "Verbose and difficult-to-debug tracebacks.",
      "modern": "Utilize Python\u2019s enhanced traceback simplification features, especially useful in production environments, minimizing the amount of code exposed in error logs.  Configure logging appropriately to capture relevant context.",
      "benefit": "Improved debugging efficiency, reduced security risks associated with exposing sensitive code details in error logs."

      "name": "Using `asyncio.to_thread` for Blocking Operations",
      "legacy": "Blocking calls in async tasks would halt execution.",
      "modern": "Use `asyncio.to_thread` to offload blocking (CPU-bound or I/O-bound) functions to a separate thread pool, preventing the event loop from being blocked.",
      "benefit": "Maintains responsiveness in asynchronous applications while running blocking operations, prevents event loop stalls."

      "name": "Avoiding Unnecessary Object Creation",
      "legacy": "Creating many small objects frequently within loops or functions.",
      "modern": "Reuse objects whenever possible, use generators to avoid creating large lists in memory, and consider using object pools for frequently created objects. Utilize in-place operations.",
